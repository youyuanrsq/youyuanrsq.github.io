我观察了成千上万的创业者，并深思熟虑过赚取大量财富或创造重要事物所需的条件。通常，人们一开始想要前者，最终却希望实现后者。

> I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.

以下是关于如何取得非凡成功的13个想法。一旦你已经在某种程度上取得了成功（通过特权或者努力），并且希望付出努力将其转化为非凡的成功，那么这些想法都很容易实现。当然其中很多条也适用于任何人。

> Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.

## 1. 复利你自己（Compound yourself）

复利是一种魔法。无论何时何地都要寻找它。指数曲线是财富成功的关键。

> Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.

一个中等规模的企业，每年增长50%的价值，会在很短的时间内变得非常庞大。世界上很少有真正具有网络效应和高可扩展性的企业，但随着科技的发展，越来越多的企业将会具有这些特征。为了找到并创造这样的企业，付出大量的努力是非常值得的。

> A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.

你也希望自己成为一条指数曲线--你的生活应该朝着不断上升和向右的轨迹发展。朝着具有复利效应的职业发展非常重要，因为大多数职业的进展相对线性。

> You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.

你不想从事一种职业--在这种职业中，从业两年的人和从业二十年的人一样高效--你的学习速度应该保持较高的水平。随着职业的发展，你所做的每一项工作都应该产生越来越多的成果。有很多方法可以获得这种杠杆效应，比如资本、技术、品牌、网络效应和人员管理。

> You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.

集中精力将你定义为成功的指标的数值增加一个0是很有用的--无论是财富、低位、对世界的影响，还是其他什么。我愿意花费尽可能多的时间咋项目之间，以找到下一个目标。但我总希望这个项目，如果成功，会使得我职业生涯的其余部分显得微不足道。

> It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.

大多数人被线性机会所困扰。（你）应该放弃一些小机会，专注于潜在的巨大变革。

> Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.

我认为在商业上取得最大的竞争优势--无论是对于公司还是个人的职业--是具有长期思维，广阔视角，以及对世界上不同系统是如何融合的全面观点。复利增长的一个显著特点是，最遥远的未来是最重要的。在一个几乎没有人采取真正长期观点的世界上，市场会丰厚奖励那些这样做的人。

> I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.

相信指数曲线，保持耐心，最好愉快的惊喜准备。

Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.

## 2. 具备非常大的自信（Have almost too much self-belief）

自信力量极大。我认识的最成功的人对自己的自信几乎到了自欺欺人的程度。

> Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.

要在早期培养这种自信。随着你拥有越来越多的证据，证明你的判断是准确的，你可以持续的取得成果，就更应该相信自己。

> Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.

如果你不相信自己，很难让自己拥有对未来的反向思考。但正是这种思考方式创造了大部分的价值。

> If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

我记得很多年前埃隆·马斯克带我参观SpaceX工厂时，他详谈到了火箭的每一个部件的制作过程，但我记忆犹新的是当他谈到将大型火箭送往火星是，他脸上的绝对确定的表情。我离开时想到：“嗯，这就是坚定信念的标杆。”

> I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”

管理自己的士气和团队的士气是大多数事业中最大的挑战之一。如果没有足够的自信，几乎是不可能实现的。不幸的是，你越是雄心勃勃，世界就越会试图打击你。

> Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  

大多数非常成功的人至少在某个时候对未来的预测是非常准确的，而当时人们确认为他是错的。否则，他们将面临更多的竞争。

> Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.

自信必须与自我认知相平衡。我过去讨厌任何形式的批评，并积极回避它。现在，我试着总是假设批评时真实的，并决定是否采取行动。寻求真相是困难且痛苦的，但这是将自信与自欺欺人区分开来的关键。

> Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.

这种平衡也有助于避免显得自以为是和脱离实际。

This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.

## 3. 学会独立思考（Learn to think independently）

创业非常难以传授，因为原创思维非常难以传授。学校并不致力于教授这个，事实上，它通常倾向于奖励相反的行为。因此你必须自己培养他。

> Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.

从第一性原理出发， 尝试产生新的想法是有趣的，找到可以交流这些想法的人是提高这方面能力的好方法。下一步是找到在现实世界中快速简单的测试这些想法的方法。

> Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.

“我会失败很多次，但有一次我会真正成功。”这是创业者的心态。你必须给自己很多机会去获得幸运。

“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.

你需要知道的最有价值的教训之一是你可以在看似无解的情况下找到解决方法。你做到这一点的次数越多，你就会越相信自己的能力。坚毅意味着学会在跌倒后重新站起来。

> One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.

## 4. 提高销售能力（Get good at “sales”）

仅仅拥有自信还不足够，你还必须能够说服其他人相信你的信念。

> Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.

所有伟大的职业，在某种程度上，都变成了销售工作。你必须向客户、潜在员工、媒体、投资者等推销你的计划。这需要激发人心的愿景、良好的沟通技巧、一定程度的个人魅力和执行能力的证明。

> All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.

提高沟通能力——特别是书面沟通——是一项值得投资的能力。我在清晰沟通方面的最佳建议是，首先确保你的思路清晰，然后使用简洁明了的语言。

> Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.

成为一名出色的销售人员的最佳方法是真正相信你所销售的东西。销售自己真正相信的东西会让人感觉很棒，而销售毒药的感觉则很糟糕。

> The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.

提高销售能力就像提高任何其他技能一样——通过有意识的练习，任何人都可以变得更好。但由于某种原因，也许是因为它给人一种不愉快的感觉，许多人把它视为一种无法学习的东西。

> Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable.

我另一个重要的销售技巧是，在重要场合尽量亲自出席。当我刚开始工作时，我总是愿意乘飞机去见面。这通常是不必要的，但有三次这样的决定给了我职业上的转折点，否则情况可能会有所不同。

> My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.

## 5. 勇于承担风险（Make it easy to take risks）

大多数人高估了风险，低估了回报。冒险是重要的，因为无法始终正确无误——你必须尝试很多事情，并随着学习的深入而快速适应变化。

> Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.

在职业生涯的早期，冒险往往更容易；你没有太多可以失去的东西，但潜在的回报却很大。一旦你已经能够满足基本的责任，你应该努力让自己更容易冒险。寻找那些如果你错误会损失1倍，但如果成功将获得100倍回报的小赌注。然后在那个方向上进行更大的投注。

> It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.

不过也不要储蓄太久。在 YC（Y Combinator），我们经常注意到那些在谷歌或 Facebook 工作了很长时间的创始人存在一个问题。当人们习惯了舒适的生活、可预测的工作以及在任何事情上都获得成功的声誉时，很难离开这一切（人们有一种令人难以置信的能力，总是将他们的生活方式与明年的薪水相匹配）。即使他们离开了，回归的诱惑也很大。将短期利益和便利置于长期满足之上是容易而符合人性的。

> Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.  

但当你没有过多地奔波时，你可以跟随直觉，花时间在可能会变得非常有趣的事情上。尽可能保持生活的廉价和灵活性，这是一种强大的方式，但显然也有一些取舍。

> But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.

## 6. 专注（Focus）

专注是工作中的乘数效应。

> Focus is a force multiplier on work.

我遇到过的几乎每个人都会受益于花更多时间思考要专注于什么。与工作多少小时相比，工作在正确的事情上要重要得多。大多数人把大部分时间浪费在无关紧要的事情上。

> Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

一旦你弄清楚了要做什么，就要毫不停歇地迅速完成你那几个最重要的事情。我还没有见过一个行动迟缓的人取得很大成功的例子。

> Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.

## 7. 努力工作（Work hard）

通过聪明工作或努力工作，你可以在自己的领域达到大约90%的水平，这仍然是一个伟大的成就。但要达到99%的水平则需要两者兼备——你将与其他非常有才华、有很多好点子并愿意努力工作的人竞争。

> You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.

极端的人获得极端的结果。努力工作会伴随着巨大的生活取舍，决定不这样做是完全合理的。但它有很多优势。就像在大多数情况下一样，势头是可以累积的，成功会带来更多的成功。

> Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.

而且这通常非常有趣。生活中的一大乐趣就是找到你的目标，在其中取得卓越的成就，并发现你的影响对于比你个人更大的事物是有意义的。最近，一位Y Combinator的创始人在离开大公司的工作后，为了追求他可能达到的最大影响力而工作，表达了对自己更加快乐和满足的巨大惊讶。在这个目标上努力工作应该受到赞扬。

> And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.  

我不完全清楚为什么在美国的某些地区，努力工作已经成为一种贬义词，但在世界其他地区，情况肯定不是这样——美国以外的企业家们所展现出的能量和动力正在迅速成为新的标杆。

> It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.

你必须找到如何努力工作而不过度劳累的方法。人们会找到自己的策略，但几乎总是有效的一种策略是找到你喜欢与之共事并享受与之相处很多时间的人一起工作。

> You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.

我认为那些假装你可以在职业生涯中大部分时间不努力工作而取得超级成功的人是在误导。实际上，工作耐力似乎是长期成功的最大预测因素之一。

> I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.

关于努力工作的另一个想法：在职业生涯的开始阶段努力工作。辛勤工作像利息一样增长，你越早开始，获得回报的时间就越多。而且在你有较少其他责任的时候，努力工作也更容易，虽然这在年轻时并非总是如此，但经常是这样。

> One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.

## 8. 勇敢一点（Be bold）

我相信，创办一家困难的创业公司要比创办一家简单的创业公司更容易。人们想要成为令人激动的事情的一部分，并且感觉自己的工作是有意义的。

> I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.

如果你在解决一个重要的问题上取得进展，你将拥有一股持续不断的人们想要帮助你的助力。让自己变得更有雄心壮志，不要害怕从事你真正想要从事的工作。

> If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.

如果其他人都在创办文本编辑器公司，而你想创办一家基因编辑公司，那就去做，不要犹豫不决。

> If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.

追随你的好奇心。对你来说激动人心的事情往往也会激动其他人。

> Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.

## 9. 更加自主（Be willful）

一个重要的秘诀是，你可以在很大程度上按照自己的意愿改变世界——大多数人甚至不尝试，他们只是接受事情的现状。

> A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.

人们有巨大的能力让事情发生。自我怀疑、过早放弃和不够努力阻止了大多数人实现自己潜力的可能性。

> People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

勇于要求你想要的东西。你通常不会得到它，而且拒绝通常会令人痛苦。但当这种方法奏效时，它会有出乎意料的好结果。

> Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.

几乎总是那些说“我会一直坚持下去，不管遇到什么困难，我都会想办法解决”的人，而且是认真的人，最终会成功。他们坚持得足够长，给自己一次幸运的机会。

> Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.

对于这一点，Airbnb是我的标杆。他们讲述了很多我不建议尝试重现的故事（比如在那种用来放棒球卡片的九格三环文件夹中存放满满的信用卡，每顿饭只吃一美元店的谷片，与强大既得利益的斗争等等），但他们设法坚持下来，等待幸运降临。

> Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way.

要具有意愿力，你必须乐观——希望这是一种可以通过实践提高的个人品质。我从未见过一个非常成功的悲观主义者。

> To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.

## 10. 变得很难被挑战（Be hard to compete with）

大多数人都明白，如果一家公司难以与之竞争，那么它的价值更高。这一点很重要，也很显然。

> Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true.

但对于你个人来说也是如此。如果你所做的事情可以被别人做，最终也会有其他人来做，并且以更少的费用。

> But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.

成为难以与之竞争的最佳方式是建立优势。例如，你可以通过人际关系建立优势，建立强大的个人品牌，或者擅长多个不同领域的交叉点。还有许多其他策略，但你必须找到一种方法来做到这一点。

> The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.

大多数人会按照他们周围的人做的事情去做。这种模仿行为通常是一个错误——如果你做的和其他人一样，那么你就不会难以与之竞争。

> Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.

## 11. 建立人际关系网络（Build a network）

伟大的工作需要团队。发展一个与人才合作的人际网络——有时密切，有时松散——是伟大职业的重要组成部分。你认识的真正有才华的人的网络规模往往成为你能够实现某事的限制因素。

> Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.

建立人际网络的有效方法是尽力帮助他人。长时间以来，我通过这样做获得了大部分最好的职业机会和四笔最好的投资。令我不断惊讶的是，很多时候因为我十年前帮助一位创始人而发生了一些好事。

> An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.

建立人际网络的最佳方式之一是以真正关心与你合作的人为特点。在分享利益方面要非常慷慨；这将以10倍的回报回到你身上。此外，学会评估人们擅长的领域，并将他们放在适合他们的角色上。（这是我关于管理最重要的一点，我没有读过太多相关的东西。）你希望有一个推动人们努力工作，让他们完成超出他们预期的成就，但不会让他们精疲力尽的声誉。

> One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.

每个人在某些方面都比其他方面更擅长。以你的优势来定义自己，而不是强调自己的弱点。承认你的弱点，并找出如何绕过它们的方法，但不要让它们阻止你做你想做的事情。“我不能做X，因为我不擅长Y”是我从创业者那里听到的一种想法，而且几乎总是反映了缺乏创造力。弥补自己的弱点的最佳方式是雇佣能够补充你的团队成员，而不仅仅是雇佣和你一样擅长同样事物的人。

> Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.

建立人际网络中特别有价值的一部分是善于发现未被发现的人才。通过实践，快速发现智慧、动力和创造力变得更加容易。学习的最简单方法就是结识很多人，并记录下谁给你留下了深刻印象，谁没有。记住，你主要寻找的是进步速度，不要过于看重经验或目前的成就。

> A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.

当我遇到一个新人时，我总是问自己：“这个人是个不可阻挡的力量吗？”这是一个相当不错的启发式方法，可以找到可能取得伟

> I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.

建立人际网络的一个特殊情况是找到一位知名人士来支持你，最好是在职业生涯的早期。做到这一点的最好方式是尽力去帮助他人。（记住，你以后要回报这种帮助！）

> A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)

最后，请记住要与支持你的抱负的积极的人共度时光。

> Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.

## 12. 通过拥有资产来致富（You get rich by owning things）

我小时候最大的经济误解是认为人们通过高薪水变得富有。虽然也有一些例外——比如娱乐界的明星——但在福布斯富豪榜的历史上，几乎没有人是靠薪水跻身其中的。

> The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.

你通过拥有那些价值迅速增长的东西来真正致富。

> You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.

这可以是一家企业的股份、房地产、自然资源、知识产权或其他类似的东西。但不管怎样，你需要拥有某种资产的所有权，而不仅仅卖掉你的时间。时间只能线性增长。

> This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.

让东西迅速增值的最好方法是以规模生产人们想要的东西。

> The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale.

## 13. 自驱（Be internally driven）

大多数人主要是外在驱动的；他们做事情是因为他们想要给别人留下好印象。这有很多不好的原因，但这里有两个重要的原因。

> Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.

首先，你会致力于共识的想法和共识的职业道路。你会非常在意——远超你意识到的——其他人是否认为你正在做正确的事情。这可能会阻止你从事真正有趣的工作，即使你做了，其他人也会做。

> First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.

其次，你通常会错误地进行风险计算。你会非常关注跟上其他人，不在竞争游戏中落后，即使是在短期内。

> Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.

聪明的人似乎特别容易陷入这种外在驱动的行为。意识到这一点是有帮助的，但只是一点点帮助——你很可能需要非常努力地避免陷入模仿的陷阱。

> Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap.

我认识的最成功的人主要是内在驱动的；他们做事情是为了给自己留下深刻印象，并且因为他们觉得自己有责任在世界上做些事情。当你赚到足够的钱可以买任何你想要的东西，并且获得足够的社会地位，以至于追求更多的乐趣已经不再有趣时，这是我所知道的唯一可以继续推动你取得更高绩效的力量。

> The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.

这就是为什么一个人的动机问题如此重要。这是我试图了解一个人的第一件事。正确的动机很难用一套规则来定义，但当你看到它时，你会知道。

> This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.

Jessica Livingston 和 Paul Graham 是我对此的标杆。在最初的几年里，Y Combinator（YC）受到广泛嘲笑，几乎没有人认为它会取得巨大的成功。但他们认为，如果成功的话，这对世界将是伟大的，他们喜欢帮助别人，并且他们坚信他们的新模式比现有模式更好。

> Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.

最终，你会通过在对你来说重要的领域做出优秀的工作来定义自己的成功。你越早朝这个方向迈进，你就能走得更远。如果你对任何事情没有痴迷，很难在这方面取得巨大的成功。

> Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.
